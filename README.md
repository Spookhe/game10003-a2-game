The purpose of this program is to create a simulation of an underwater oceanic environment.

The main objective of this assignment was to create an interactive 2D Drawing in which, I added randomization of bubbles throughout the screen aswell as OnClick mouse events where the user clicks, a colourset of 3 bubbles are randomly placed on the screen.
